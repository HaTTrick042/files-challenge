		<h1>Spike Spiegel: The Space Cowboy</h1>

		<img src="img/spike.jpg">

		<h2>Spike Spiegel is the lead character of a Japanese Anime program entitled Cowboy Bebop and one of my personal favorite fictional characters. Spike's personality is very aloof, yet precise and both physically/mentally capable. He is a master of the Jeet Kun Do martial arts style created and made famous by Bruce Lee. Spike is generally a very likeable and somewhat generic "badass" character. Despite Spike being a generally well trodden type of character, as far as story design is concerned, he is one of my personal favorites.</h2>

		<h2><a href="cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/main_page">Cowboy Bebop</a> centers around four lead characters and their adventures, mainly involving bounty hunting, across the solar system in the mid 21st century. It is an incredibly successful and popular series despite the relatively short run time of 26 episodes and the weighty/emotional subject material. In my personal opinion the show highlights alot of inner thoughts and contemplations I have had in my own life, likely leading to alot of my connections with the show's characters.</h2>
